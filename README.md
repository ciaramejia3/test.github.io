## How to Create a Batch Program

For testing and development, we will create a Q0# batch.

### Copy and Paste

First, go to the development library (5DEV). There, copy the K3S_3Q01, which will be the outline program, found in the QRPGLESRC file from the 5MOD library and paste it into 5DEV.

![Screen Shot 2020-02-26 at 9.33.34 AM.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Screen Shot 2020-02-26 at 9.33.34 AM.png) <!-- .element height="20%" width="20%" -->


This will prompt the CPYSRCF. This is a way to make sure the information is correct. Once viewed, click OK.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ciaramejia3/test.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
