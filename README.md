## How to Create a Batch Program

For testing and development, we will create a Q0# batch.

### Copy and Paste

First, go to the development library (5DEV). There, copy the K3S_3Q01, which will be the outline program, found in the QRPGLESRC file from the 5MOD library and paste it into 5DEV.

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/Screen Shot 2020-02-26 at 9.33.34 AM.png" width="700px" />

</p>


This will prompt the CPYSRCF. This is a way to make sure the information is correct. Once viewed, click OK.

</p>


### Edit the Program 

Edit the program as needed. In this batch, we will take any product that has a lead time greater than 30 days using fields found in the K_Product PF.

</p>

Once finished, be sure to edit any text documentation within the program. 


### Compile

Now we are ready to compile!

Right click on the program and compile prompt. Here, there will be an option to view advanced options. Be sure to have the correct Target Release option picked.

</p>

Once attempting to compile, check the Commands log for any errors. 



Here's a simple footnote,[^hello] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^hello]: This is the first footnote.

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.
