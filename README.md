## How to Create a Batch Program

For testing and development, we will create a Q0# batch.

### Copy and Paste

First, go to your Development library (5DEV). There you will be copying the K3S_3Q01, which will be our outline program, found in the QRPGLESRC file from your 5MOD library and pasting it into your 5DEV library.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ciaramejia3/test.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
